## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Text-to-ImageSet Generation

### 1. Set Environment
```bash
conda create -n T2IS python==3.9
conda activate T2IS
pip install xformers==0.0.28.post1 diffusers peft torchvision==0.19.1 opencv-python==4.10.0.84 sentencepiece==0.2.0 protobuf==5.28.1 scipy==1.13.1
```

### 2. Quick Start

```bash
cd T2IS_Gen
```

```python

    "The child sits cross-legged in a wooden treehouse, sketching in a notebook. Sunlight filters through leaves, dappling the pages. A jar of fireflies and binoculars rest beside him, with distant hills rendered in hazy blue layers to evoke depth and quiet imagination."
